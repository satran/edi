# Dabba

Dabba is a box for all your notes, thoughts, pictures, or any digital file. Although I use it for my daily use, I don't think it is ready for public consumption. 

## Install
You need a [Go](https://golang.org) compiler. With the compiler ready you just need to run
```
go install github.com/satran/dabba
```

If you have the executable in the PATH directory you can start the server by
```
dabba -addr "localhost:8080" -dir ~/docs 
```
